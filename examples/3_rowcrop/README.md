# Simulating row crop management: MAGiC phase 3

With full support for agronomic events now implemented in the Sipnet model,
this set of simulations demonstrates incorporating such events into the PEcAn
framework and evaluating their effect on predicted carbon dynamics in a
cropping landscape that can now be resolved into three plant functional types:

* Woody perennials such as orchards or vineyards (Fer et al 2015)[1],
* Nonwoody perennials such as hay, haylage, grazing land, etc
	(Dookohaki et al 2022)[2],
* Annually planted, actively managed row crops. These are initially represented
	as a single "nonwoody annual" plant functional type with parameters derived
	from the nonwoody perennial PFT by turning off internal phenology so that
	greenup and browndown are controlled by the externally prescribed planting
	and harvest dates.

Representing all row crops as one single PFT is a major simplification, so one
key goal of this phase is to prepare the simulation framework for a detailed
uncertainty analysis, which can then be used to inform decisions about further
dividing crop types as data become available to calibrate them.

Statewide runs continue to use the 198 sites evaluated in phase 2.
We also introduce focused validation runs using the subset of sites where
direct observations of soil carbon and/or biomass are available during the
simulation period.


## Caveats

Instructions assume a local run on MacOS and will be updated for a
Linux + Slurm + Apptainer HPC environment as we finish testing and deployment.

Aspirationally, any command prefixed with `[host_args]` is one that ought to
work on HPC by "just" adding a system-specific prefix, e.g.
`./01_ERA5_nc_to_clim.R --start_date=2016-01-01` on my machine becomes
`sbatch -n16 --mem=12G --mail-type=ALL --uid=jdoe \
	./01_ERA5_nc_to_clim.R --start_date=2016-01-01` on yours.


## Running the workflow

### 0. Copy prebuilt artifacts and set up validation data

```sh
export AWS_PROFILE=magic
aws s3 sync --exclude='mslsp/*' s3://carb/management/ ./data_raw/management
aws s3 cp s3://carb/data_raw/ERA5_CA_nc_2016_2024.tgz .
tar xf ERA5_CA_nc_2016_2024.tgz
aws s3 cp s3://carb/data/workflows/phase_3/magic_example3_input_data_20260711.tgz .
tar xf magic_example3_input_data_20260711.tgz
```

#### Validation data

To set up validation runs, you need access to the cropland soil carbon data
files `Harmonized_SiteMngmt_Croplands.csv` and `Harmonized_Data_Croplands.csv`.

These were shared for this project by CARB and CDFA, who in turn obtained them
from stakeholders (primarily Healthy Soils Program grant recipients) who
consented to use of their data for internal research purposes but explicitly
did not consent to public distribution of the data.
Contact chelsea.carey@arb.ca.gov for more information about the dataset.

Once obtained, place them in `data_raw/private/HSP` and run
```{sh}
../../tools/build_validation_siteinfo.R
```
to create `validation_site_info.csv`.


### 1. Convert climate driver files

TODO: show how to pass n_cores from host_args
(NSLOTS? SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK?)

```{sh}
[host_args] ./01_ERA5_nc_to_clim.R \
	--site_era5_path=data_raw/ERA5_CA_nc \
	--site_sipnet_met_path=data/ERA5_CA_SIPNET \
	--site_info_file=data_raw/ERA5_CA_nc/ca_half_degree_grid.csv \
	--start_date=2016-01-01 \
	--end_date=2023-12-31 \
	--n_cores=7
```

### 2. Generate initial site conditions

We'll run this twice, once for validation sites and once for statewide anchors.
It would also be fine to put both together in the same input and run it once.

NOTE: ECMWF soil moisture data calls were failing when I tried to run this for anchor sites on 2025-12-08,
so I symlinked `data/IC_prep_val/soil_moisture/` to `data/IC_prep/soil_moisture/`. On a day the server is up, this _should_ not be needed... but also isn't a problem, since that subdirectory contains global 0.25 degree/25 km soil moisture data for the first 10 days of 2016 and can be expected to be identical from one downloading to the next. The fact that we cache that output here is a quirk of how `PEcAn.data.land::extract_SM_CDS` is implemented, not a designed part of the IC workflow.


```{sh}
[host_args] ../../workflow/02_ic_build.R \
	--site_info_path=validation_site_info.csv \
	--pft_dir=data_raw/pfts \
	--data_dir=data/IC_prep_val \
	--ic_outdir=data/IC_files

../../tools/build_site_info.R --location_file=../../data/design_points.csv

[host_args] ../../workflow/02_ic_build.R \
	--site_info_path=site_info.csv \
	--pft_dir=data_raw/pfts \
	--data_dir=data/IC_prep \
	--ic_outdir=data/IC_files
```

### 2a. Generate event files

Management events are read from files produced by the monitoring pipeline or equivalent sources.
The current version assumes all event types are provided as Parquet files, and that they live in subdirectories of `mgmt_file_dir` that include specific, currently hardcoded, version numbers. See script for the details.
Future versions of the event_build script may support passing separate paths per data product and potentially also add support for alternate storage formats (e.g. allowing csv as well as parquet).

```{sh}
[host_args] ./02a_build_events.R \
  --site_info_path=validation_site_info.csv \
  --raw_parquet_dir=data_raw/management \
  --event_outdir=data/val_events
# empty raw_parquet_dir to avoid redoing cleaning already done for val
# (Cleaning runs on whole statewide file, not just selected sites)
[host_args] ./02a_build_events.R \
  --site_info_path=site_info.csv \
  --raw_parquet_dir='' \
  --event_outdir=data/events
```

For validation we need an additional hack:
`02a_build_events.R` created event files named by their *parcel* id,
but the validation dataset uses a separate set of *site* ids derived by hashing locations, experiment names, and treatment codes.
This is done to (1) keep locations opaque since the validation data are nonpublic, and (2) allow simulation of separate plots (treatments) whose locations all fall in a single parcel of the statewide map.
A future solution would be to teach `03_xml_build.R` how to find event files that are named by parcel id, so that sites which share a parcel do not need to duplicate the file.
For now though, let's duplicate the files of interest so they're named after the site IDs PEcAn will use. For now, I'm not cleaning up the originals afterwards -- they're small and might be used by other runs that reuse this data directory.

```{r}
vsi <- read.csv("validation_site_info.csv") |>
  dplyr::distinct(id, field_id) |>
  dplyr::rename(site_id = id)
vsi |> purrr::pwalk(
  \(site_id, field_id) file.copy(
    paste0("data/val_events/events-", field_id, ".in"),
    paste0("data/val_events/events-", site_id, ".in")
  )
)

# Rename sites inside JSON file, so restart code can match it for PFT changes
# Doing this by pure substitution, not parsing anything
evt_json_txt <- readLines("data/val_events/combined_events.json")
for (i in seq_along(vsi$site_id)) {
	evt_json_txt <- gsub(
		pattern = paste0('"site_id":"', vsi$field_id[[i]], '"'),
		replacement = paste0('"site_id":"', vsi$site_id[[i]], '"'),
		x = evt_json_txt
	)
}
writeLines(evt_json_txt, "data/val_events/combined_events.json")

# And rename inside the phenology file, too
read.csv("data/val_events/phenology.csv") |>
  dplyr::rename(field_id = site_id) |>
  dplyr::left_join(vsi) |>
  write.csv("data/val_events/phenology.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


### 3. Generate settings file

```{sh}
[host_args] ./03_xml_build.R \
	--end_date=2023-12-31 \
	--ic_dir=data/IC_files \
	--site_file=validation_site_info.csv \
	--event_dir=data/val_events \
	--output_file=validation_settings.xml \
	--output_dir=val_out
[host_args] ./03_xml_build.R \
	--ic_dir=data/IC_files \
	--end_date=2023-12-31 \
	--site_file=site_info.csv \
	--output_file=settings.xml \
	--output_dir=output
```

### 4. Set up model run directories

TODO: Yes, it's unintuitive that we can't rename the output dir at this
stage instead of in xml_build.

```{sh}
[host_args] ./04_set_up_runs.R --settings=validation_settings.xml
[host_args] ./04_set_up_runs.R --settings=settings.xml
```

### 5. Run model

```{sh}
export NCPUS=8
ln -s [your/path/to]/sipnet/sipnet sipnet
[host_args] ./05_run_model.R --settings=val_out/pecan.CONFIGS.xml
[host_args] ./05_run_model.R --settings=output/pecan.CONFIGS.xml
```

### 6. Validate

```{sh}
[host_args] ./validate.R \
	--model_dir=val_out \
	--output_dir=validation_results_$(date '+%s')
```
