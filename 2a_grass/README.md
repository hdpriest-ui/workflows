# Statewide crop modeling with two PFTs: MAGiC phase 2a

This simulation expands on phase 1b by introducing a non-woody PFT,
using generalized grassland parameters developed by Dookohaki et al (2022)[1].
As run here it is treated as a perennial to simulate hay and pasture land;
to simulate row crops we expect to use the same parameters in combination with
Sipnet's newly added planting and harvest event capabilities.

Here we generate model outputs for 198 locations:
The 98 orchards used in phase 1b, plus 100 nonwoody sites. These are then scaled and propagated to statewide carbon estimates using the MAGiC downscaling workflow (reported separately).

Further improvements compared to phase 1b include:

* Initial conditions for aboveground biomass are now averaged from all
	LandTrendr grid cells within the target DWR field polygon
	(previously used a fixed 90m point buffer)
* Initial condition calculations now read specific leaf area and leaf carbon
	concentration from the correct PFT for the site
	(previously hard-coded to values for woody plants)
* Runtime configuration parameters can now be set via command-line arguments
	(previously hard-coded at the top of each script file)
* Initial conditions script now checks for existing data one site at a time
	and only fetches data from sites not already present
	(previously had to fetch all sites for a parameter at once).
	This gives a substantial time savings when adding a few new sites to the
	existing set.



All instructions below assume you are working on a Linux cluster that uses Slurm as its scheduler; adjust the batch parameters as needed for your system. Many of the scripts are also configurable by editing designated lines at the top of the script; the explanations in these sections are worth reading and understanding even if you find the default configuration to be suitable.


## How to run the workflow

### Install SIPNET Binary

If you haven't already installed SIPNET, this downloads the SIPNET v2.0.0 binary and creates symlink. We recommend keeping it in the project root directory for easy access by all workflow components:

```
wget -O ../sipnet https://github.com/PecanProject/sipnet/releases/download/v2.0.0/sipnet
chmod +x ../sipnet
ln -sf ../sipnet ../sipnet.git
```

### Install or update PEcAn

If this is a brand-new installation, expect this step to take a few hours to download and compile more than 300 R packages. If you've installed PEcAn on this machine before, expect it to be just a few minutes of updating only the PEcAn packages and any dependencies whose version requirement has changed.
Defaults to using 4 CPUs to compile packages in parallel. If you have more cores, adjust `sbatch`'s `--cpus-per-task` parameter.

```
sbatch -o install_pecan.out ../tools/install_pecan.sh
```

### Copy prebuilt input artifacts

These are files that were easier to prepare from the (many terabytes of) raw
files available on the Dietze lab's server at Boston University.
Rather than make users copy or re-download all the raw files, we've packaged
the inputs needed for this specific run.

Specifically, the archive contains: `pfts/`, `data_raw/ERA5_nc/`,
`data/IC_prep/*.csv`, `data/events.in` and `site_info.csv`.

These data are available to anyone on request, but require a login for
bandwidth control. If you do not yet have an access key, please contact the
CCMMF team for credentials.

The artifact tarball is available in an S3 bucket hosted by NCSA at
`s3.garage.ccmmf.ncsa.cloud`. We recommend using
[rclone](https://rclone.org/install/) to download it:

```{sh}
cat << EOF >> ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
[ccmmf]
type = s3
provider = Other
env_auth = false
access_key_id = [your key ID]
secret_access_key = [your secret key]
region = garage
endpoint = https://s3.garage.ccmmf.ncsa.cloud
force_path_style = true
acl = private
bucket_acl = private
EOF
```

```{sh}
rclone copy ccmmf:carb/data/workflows/phase_2a/ccmmf_phase_2a_input_artifacts.tgz ./
tar -xzf ccmmf_phase_2a_input_artifacts.tgz
````

You can also use other tools of your choice that speak the S3 protocol,
including Cyberduck or the AWS cli. Note that `aws s3` calls will need to set
`--endpoint-url https://s3.garage.ccmmf.ncsa.cloud` or equivalent.
Details not shown here for brevity, but available on request.


### Create IC files

```{sh}
module load r
sbatch -n1 --cpus-per-task=4 01_ERA5_nc_to_clim.R --n_cores=4
srun ./02_ic_build.R
srun ./03_xml_build.R
```


### Model execution

Now run Sipnet on the prepared settings + IC files.

(Note: The 10 hour `--time` limit shown here is definitely excessive; my test runs took about an hour of wall time).

```{sh}
module load r
sbatch --mem-per-cpu=1G --time=10:00:00 \
  --output=ccmmf_phase_1b_"$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)_%j.log" \
  ./04_run_model.R -s settings.xml
```

## Sensitivity analysis

In addition to the statewide runs, we present in notebook
`parameter_sensitivity.Rmd` a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis of the effects
of all parameters specified for each PFT (28 parameters for woody crops,
22 for nonwoody) on modeled aboveground biomass, NPP, evapotranspiration,
soil moisture, and soil carbon across the whole 2016-2023 simulation period. The analysis was repeated at each of 5 locations for each PFT.

The major takeaway from the sensitivity analysis is that leaf growth and specific leaf area account for a large fraction of the observed model response across sites, PFTs, and response variables, while photosynthetic rate parameters such as half-saturation PAR, Amax, and `Vm_low_temp` explain much of the productivity and water use response in woody plants but are less important for the nonwoody PFT. Parameters related to the temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis (`Vm_low_temp`, `PsnTOpt`) were considerably more elastic (i.e. larger proportional change in model output per unit change in parameter value) than other parameters this was variable from site to site while most other responses were broadly similar across sites.

Note that this analysis considers parameter sensitivity only and not uncertainty around initial conditions, management, or environmental drivers.
